description: Overview of Cherax Lua scripts like Silent Night, Codax, Bunnyscript, Jinxscript, and more.

> **Note:** For making Lua scripts, refer to [Writing Lua Scripts](/guides/creating-luas).

## What are Luas in Cherax?

Luas are scripts intended to help you with select things, such as:

- Recoveries (earning money from heists or business management)
- Vehicle modding (getting custom vehicle mods like F1/Benny wheels, custom colors and so much more)
- Fun (trolling others, some QOL features and more)

To run a Lua, you have to go to the loader or the cherax website, subscribe to a script you want then go to the game, open up your menu then navigate to settings, and in the bottom right you can refresh scripts and finally load it.

## Silent Night (heist tool)

Silent Night is a script developed by SilentSalo back in 2022, whilst it is **mostly** classified as a heist tool it also has business management and the infamous dev tool, which is used for editing variables in game such as your stats.

## Codax (business management)

Codax by WhiteWatermelon is usually discouraged by Cherax users as they got banned using it quite a few times, but it was mostly their own responsibility as they probably went overboard with their earnings and triggered many flags. Besides business management Codax is also great for:

- Heists (a bit more different in functionality compared to Silent Night)
- Maximizing Stats
- Much more (check out the Supporter version)

## Bunnyscript (vehicle-focused)

Bunnyscript by itsBunny is mainly designed for pimping out your rides, giving users a lot more advanced access to their vehicles, including:

- Bypassing Los Santos Customs/Benny's restrictions to be able to put any vehicle inside of their mod shops
- Making vehicles with F1/Benny's wheels, custom license plates and custom Hex colors for Primary or Secondary
- Saving spawned vehicles as personal ones even if the user has Cherax Standard

## Jinxscript (multitool for fun and QOL)

Jinxscript by Prisuhm adds nearly 600 features to your menu, including:

- Fully customizable audio manager
- Game enhancements (better Alt F4, bypass LSC restrictions, better gun van weapons)
- Weapon Manager (giving yourself ammo, modifying weapons, etc)
- Remote Recovery
- Fun Features (player menu offers features to other players as well, giving your friends a nice "modder" feel as well)
- And much more (check the script for yourself to see everything)

## Other Luas (honorable mentions)

Some of these Luas are used a bit less then the ones mentioned above, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve the same love, that includes:

- K-Script by XeKyuubii (powerful crashing, trolling and QOL features, including FiveM style emotes and NAT type spoofing for advertising)
- Trolley by WhiteWatermelon (troll oriented, even has airstrike features to really spook your friends and other players)
- OutfitModeler by Weyzox (a wonderful script for making custom modded outfits)
- Ji9sw Gun Van by Ji9sw (lets you modify the contents of the gun van, as the weapon selection is usually randomized in it, think casino rigging for weapons)
- Chairhax by SATTY (a legendary script packed with advanced features, including an extensive CLI, custom structure creator with Menyoo support, trolling and fun tools)
- BiggerScript by MinorityCrasher (lets you spawn thousands of modded vehicles, maps and outfits, even has a spooner to let you create your own)
- Project Hydra, Cherax RPG and Discord RPC by Duchess (Hydra adds a Ace Combat 7 HUD for Cherax, RPG adds missions to the Day to day gaming and is pretty much idle while driving around, whilst Discord RPC adds a nice little indicator to other discord users that you're using the menu)
- Auto Translator by Do6563 (detects your GTA language and automatically downloads and loads the correlated translation)
- Cherax Chat by tumult1337 (WIP Global Chat with Discord bridge)
- CyberPilot HUD and Extended Constructor by elfish-beaker (adds a new and improved HUD to the game, whilst the other one is an object manipulation script)
- Spooner by Anonymous50000 (adds the Spooner menu from the Menyoo days)
- NannoScript by Baloo (we love NannoScript)
- Command Line by WhiteWatermelon (simply adds a command line that's accessible by Insert key)
