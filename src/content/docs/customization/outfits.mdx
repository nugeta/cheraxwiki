## Getting Started

Before you get started with modded outfits refer to [Getting Full Access to Channels](/purchasing/getting-full-access-to-channels/).

## Downloading outfits

It is very simple to download outfits, so tag along and let's go:

- Go to the Cherax Discord server and navigate to #outfit-shares
- Find an outfit you like, then find the corresponding .json file for it
- Press the 3 dots on the .json file and then "Download"

The file will then be downloaded and we can move over to the next step.

## Loading Outfits

Loading outfits is fairly as simple, and it goes as follows:

- Take your downloaded file and cut or copy it into Documents/Cherax/Outfits
- Inject and open the menu then go to Player (first icon), Cosmetics and scroll down
- Find the dropdown under the category "Saving", select your outfit and load it.

Now you have applied the outfit on your current character, it's time to save it.

## Saving outfits

You *may* lose some clothing items when saving depending on if the items are blacklisted or not.

- Go to any clothing shop, whether it'd be a Discount Store, Binco, Ponsonbys etc.
- In the menu, back in Cosmetics, turn on the 2 features to remove outfit restrictions
- Press E on the cashier and then space to overwrite your saved outfits

## Video Explanation

Below is a video tutorial of what I have just explained beforehand, in the case that you don't understand something.
