> Refer to this [Startup.lua](/purchasing/getting-started/#fixing-startuplua) guide to find out how to auto load themes once injected

## Downloading themes

As always, make sure you've synced your roles, if not then refer to the [Getting Full Access to Channels](/purchasing/getting-full-access-to-channels/) tutorial.

- Go to the Cherax server and then theme-shares
- Find a theme you like and then press the three dots and download it
- Determine if it's for the ClickGUI or ListGUI, or both (ClickGUI is wide and used with mouse, ListGUI is tall and used with arrow keys)

## Importing the theme

- Check what kind of file you downloaded, it's usually a zip file, if so then extract it and Cut/Copy the folder inside
- Paste the folder into Documents/Cherax/Theme
- Make sure that if it's a ClickGUI theme to put it in the ClickGUI folder and vice versa for ListGUI

## Loading the theme up

The hardest part is complete, now all that is left is to:

- Inject if you haven't already and open up the menu
- Navigate down to the settings (one of the last options, cog icon)
- Go to the themes dropdown, select your theme and load it.

In the case you don't follow the [Startup.lua](/purchasing/getting-started/#fixing-startuplua) guide, you will have to manually load the theme back up everytime.

## Video Explanation

Below is a video explanation (as always lmao) of how to do it in game, making it easier to follow
