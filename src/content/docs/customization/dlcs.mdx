> **Note:** This only works on the Legacy Edition of the game.

## Downloading DLCs

To get started make sure you've already synced your roles from the first steps in the [Outfits](../outfits/) tutorial

- Go to the Cherax server then dlc-shares
- Find a car you like and then press the three dots then download
- If it's a .zip file, open it and find a folder inside with the name of the vehicle, usually inside Add-ons if its from a third party source
- Put the folder with the .rpf file in Documents/Cherax/DLCs

## Loading DLCs
To spawn DLC vehicles or become a DLC ped, you must load the DLC up first.

- Navigate to Misc in the menu and find the DLC category
- Either load your selected DLC or load every DLC
- You should see a message saying that it has loaded "x amount of vehicles and x amount of peds"

Make sure you don't load too many DLCs or the game may have a memory leak.

## Spawning DLC Vehicles

Now it's finally time for the fun part:

- Navigate to spawner (garage icon) and then on the right side scroll all the way down to the last category called DLC
- Select the vehicle you loaded and either spawn it with the button on your left or by double clicking the car name
- Go ride your shi now, some DLCs support upgrades and such making them look slightly different

## Becoming a DLC Ped

Process is almost identical:

- Navigate to Player (first icon) and then Cosmetics
- Find the Ped menu and in the dropdown scroll all the way down till you see DLC
- Load it up and enjoy, just make sure to give yourself all weapons if you need them as changing Peds usually removes them for you.

If you want to go back to the way it used to be, kill your character, then go change your outfit in appearance
