> **Important note:** Cherax is **not** available to directly purchase from the website itself, only from external resellers or staff members.

## How do I get started with purchasing Cherax?

To get started with purchasing Cherax, head over to the [Cherax Website](https://cherax.menu/landing). 

Next up, choose the plan that you'd like to purchase, visit [this part of the page](#whats-the-best-cherax-plan-to-buy) to determine which plan suits you the best.

## Which reseller is the best?

One of the best resellers to consider will probably have to be [Cyprus Mods](https://cypruscommunity.net/product/gta-cherax), they support a lot of the most common payment methods and sell Cherax at below MSRP, and with code **XTREME**, you save an additional 5%, so it is even more affordable! Here are the payment methods they take listed below:

- **Cashapp**
- **Venmo**
- **Crypto (LTC,BTC,ETC...)**
- **Prepaid MasterCard and Visa Gift Cards**
- **Amazon Gift Cards (USD)**
- **Debit/Credit cards (Stripe Checkout)**
- **UPI**

If your payment method isn't listed here, go back to the Cherax website and check if another reseller supports your specific payment method.

## What are the prices for Standard, Premium and Prime?

- Standard should cost you about €25

- Premium should cost you about €50

- As for prime, you **must** have already owned Premium for a minimum of 3 months, after which it is €30/month with plans for 3 and 6 months

## Where do I receive my key after purchase?

**Most**, if not all resellers follow a system where after purchase you will **most likely** receive the key in your receipt that they send you through email. 

Staff and other resellers mostly have ticket systems and similar, meaning you'll most likely receive the key directly from them after paying.

## I found a site with my payment method, but they're out of stock. What should I do?

A lot of resellers tend to run out of keys, especially if they're on high demand.

The solution to this is to either find a new site which also suits your specific payment method, or simply wait. **Patience is gold.**

# What's the best Cherax plan to buy?

Between Standard and Premium, people usually go for Premium because of the following features:

- Free Shopping (makes almost **anything** in the game buyable for free even if you don't have enough balance)

- Convert to PV (you can save any spawned/NPC vehicle that you are in as a personal vehicle, meaning that you keep it forever)

- Free GTA+ (spoofs your GTA+ status to let you get all the perks, such as the 100 slot Vinewood Club Garage, early access to new vehicles etc)

- Traffic Variety (makes the streets of Los Santos a bit less boring by making you able to manipulate the traffic)

- Money and RP drops (relive the good old days)

# Are all the resellers safe?

**All** of the resellers that are linked in the Resellers page in the Cherax Website are verified and legit. There are no "safer" resellers, they are all equally as safe to purchase from.
