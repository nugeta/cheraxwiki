> **Note:** Prime is **INVITE ONLY**. You will need an invite by a prime member beforehand.

## What is Prime?

Prime is the highest tier of Cherax, it's subscription based instead of lifetime.

It has 3 different prices depending on the duration you'd like:
- €30 for 1 Month
- €60 for 3 Months
- €100 for 6 Months

## How to be eligible for Prime?
To be eligible for prime, you **need** to have fulfilled these 3 requirements:

- You must have owned Cherax Premium for 3 months or more
- You must receive an invite from an existing Prime member
- You must pay in a small time period after getting invited

## Why should I get Prime?

Prime isn't for everyone, you will only really need it if you want to have a BattlEye bypass, aka play in public lobbies when you're not the host.

Besides that, there's not much to it other than that, you may get early access to other tools made by Cherax developers, but that's about it.

## How do I buy Prime after getting invited?

After getting invited, find a prime reseller. That's literally it.
