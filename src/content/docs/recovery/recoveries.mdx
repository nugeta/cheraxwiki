> **Important note:** ALWAYS stay in the money earning limits, as for heists those values are **30 Mil** a day and **150 Mil** a week

## What are recoveries?

Recovery (or recoveries) is modder slang for account unlocks and money earning, including:

- Doing modded heists and business management
- Setting a custom RP level
- General unlocks like vehicle mods, weaponry, trophies etc

Be responsible when doing account modding and unlocks, don't trigger flags unnecessarily

## Setting RP level

Setting RP levels has never been easier, especially because of the RP correction method:

- Open your menu and navigate to Recovery
- Type in any RP level you want and apply it
- Change your session and see the message "Rockstar Services have corrected your RP to x"

Make sure to not act dumb with this one as putting a RP level that's too high, for example 8000 or below, will surely get you reported a lot, and eventually banned.

## Unlocking trophies

There's not much to say here, on the right side of the Recovery page you have every single unlockable trophy, so the steps below will explain how to showcase your unlocked trophies in the recently introduced Mansions:

- Press the Unlock All Mansion Trophies button (one of the last)
- Go to your mansion, press M then mansion customization
- Make sure you're at the floor where the trophy showcases are and then manage them from there

## Arena War career items, vehicle mods, clothing, etc.

This section is as simple as the previous ones:

- To get all vehicle mods and Arena War level 1000, just press Unlock Vehicle Mods
- To get all the Career rewards, do so with the respective button and you'll earn about 9-10 Million and a lot of RP and clothing, plus a few vehicles and helicopters to the side
- For every larger scale unlock like Clothing, Tattoos and similar, make sure to wait a little bit or change your session to apply the changes nice and quickly

## Tying recoveries to Luas

[Luas](/customization/luas/) are an important part of account recovery, especially Silent Night and Codax, here are some valuable informations to know about them

If you own the Supporter version of Silent Night, you can have:
- 3.6 Million payout in Diamond Casino
- 3.0 Million payout in Apartment
- 2.55 Million payout in Cayo Perico
- 2.55 Million payout in Doomsday

If you choose to use Codax, make sure that you are responsible with the amount of money that you earn, as personally I see too many people complaining about how they got several of their accounts banned after only using Codax for recoveries.

**Side Note:** If you want your preps to stay after an Instant Finish, then go to your Silent Night settings then in the "Instant Finish" category put Apartment to "Old"
