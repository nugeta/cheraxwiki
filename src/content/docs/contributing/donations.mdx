## Who am I?

Hi there, my name is Ghost, I am a experienced modder, some may even call me a veteran, as I've been modding for a good 6 years already. I didn't want my knowledge to go to waste so I wanted to archive it in some way, and here we are! A full blown wiki on the best mod menu in the GTA modding community!

## What payment methods do you take?

I take a wide variety of payment methods, boasting from the usuals to even custom requests, here are some of the most common ones:

- Paypal
- Crypto (any stable currency, for example BTC, LTC, ETH, SOL etc)
- Bank/Revolut Transfer
- CS2 skins
- Steam Balance (gift cards)

In the case that you'd like to donate but don't see a compatible payment method, I will be glad to try to utilize whatever other payment method you offer me.

## Why should I donate?

As I said, you **don't** have to. Donating will get you special perks, like a place in the special "Donators List" page to show what a generous individual you are, as I already mentioned early sneak peeks for future updates, you will also be able to request a tutorial of your own!

## Where can I contact you?

You can send me a DM on Discord, Instagram or TikTok. All my accounts on those platforms share one username, **"gustigost"**.

## What do I do if you don't respond?

I may be doing something else or simply sleeping, to check what time is it for me go to the link below:
