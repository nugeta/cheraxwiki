## How do I contribute?

You can contribute by DM-ing me and telling me if I made a mistake anywhere, or missed a section. Also you can message me one of your own guides and I will be glad to add it to this wiki.

## I dont see a guide for something I need, what do I do?

In the case that you don't see a tutorial here, you can always refer to the #questions-and-support channel in the Cherax Discord server or DM me.

## I have a serious/urgent problem that isn't listed, what do I do?

Go to the #ticket-support channel in the Cherax Discord server and open up a ticket, staff tend to reply quite quickly depending on the time and they will be more then glad to help you out.
