## Downloading modded vehicles

To get started make sure you've already synced your roles in the previous outfit tutorial

- Go to the Cherax server then json-vehicles
- Find a car you like and then press the three dots then download
- Cut or copy it into Documents/Cherax/Vehicles

## Spawning modded vehicles
There are 2 ways to do this, one with the native spawner, and the other with Bunnyscript

- Go to the spawner (garage icon), then scroll down and in the dropdown menu find your vehicle, select it and load it up
**OR**
- Subscribe to Bunnyscript, go to the spawner and select the vehicle you'd like to spawn and spawn it.

The reason why I mention the Bunnyscript method is because the usual spawner dropdown is unorganized, whilst the Bunnyscript dropdown recognizes folders, making it much cleaner and easier to organize.

## Saving methods

There are quite a few methods that are used by both Standard and Premium users to get vehicles, this includes:

- Converting the vehicle into a PV
- Buying insurance for it with LSC bypass
- Autosaving to garage

Shoutout to Bunny for being an absolute legend of the vehicle modding community.

## Method 1 (PREMIUM ONLY)

This is by far the fastest and most simple method to save a vehicle:

- Navigate to the spawner and scroll down
- Spawn your vehicle of choice and stay in it
- Press "Convert vehicle to PV" and select your desired garage

## Method 2 (PREMIUM AND STANDARD)

For this part you can use either Jinxscript or Bunnyscript.

For Bunnyscript go to options and toggle on "Bypass LSC" and in Jinxscript go to Online then "Remove LSC Restrictions

Now let's get to saving:

- Go to the nearest LSC or to Benny's
- Make sure that you do all the mods you want before saving
- Go to Loss/Theft Prevention and buy the Tracker and Full Coverage (costs a fraction of the vehicle itself)

## Method 3 (PREMIUM AND STANDARD)

I personally love this method, and I believe that it's one of the best:

- Go to the Spawner section in Bunnyscript
- Select the vehicle you want in the dropdown
- Toggle on "Auto Save" and you'll be put in a Buffalo
- Go to any garage with it and once the cutscene ends your Buffalo will be replaced by your selected vehicle
