## Getting Started

Has it ever occured to you that someone linked a channel in the server for you, but all you see is #No Access or #invalid-channel? Well this guide is the right solution for you!

## Connecting your discord account

- Head on over into the [Cherax Website](https://cherax.menu/) and log in if you haven't already.

- Go to your account settings then scroll down

- Connect your discord account to your Cherax then sync roles, now you have unrestricted access to the whole server.

## Why should I do this?

As I said, you get unrestricted chat access, including bypassing slowmode, but also you get access to important channels, such as:

- **Lua Scripts**

- **Lua Discussions**

- **Cherax Wallpaper**

- **Outfit Shares**

- **DLC Shares**

- **JSON Vehicles**

- **Translation Shares**

- **Theme Shares**

- **and others!**
