title: Writing Lua Scripts
description: A basic introduction to writing Lua scripts for Cherax
---

> **Note:** This guide only demonstrates an example for the Click GUI, not List GUI, but the basics are the same

## Why write your own?

You may want to write your own Lua script for a variety of reasons, such as:

- Learning Lua hands-on
- Adding trolling options that aren't available anywhere else
- Creating your own fun

## What do we need?

Before we get started, you will need the following:

- A suitable text editor or IDE, for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Some experience with Lua scripting
- Knowledge of the [Cherax API](https://docs.asuna.cat)
- And the most important, **patience**

## Getting started

Once you have everything you need, make sure you have file extensions turned on, and you can create a new Lua file in Documents/Cherax/Lua, and call it whatever you like, just don't forget the .lua at the end.

Now that you have your Lua file, it's time to do make a basic script, we will be making a simple button which just gives us a toast when we press it.

First of all, let's make our tab in Lua Content, we can do this by using the ImGui API provided by Cherax, we can start off by making a simple render function:

```lua
local function render()
    if ClickGUI.BeginCustomChildWindow("Example") then
        ClickGUI.EndCustomChildWindow()
    end
end
```

Then we add it to our Lua Content tab with `ClickGUI.AddTab("Example", render)`

That's it for now for rendering, but now we need to add our feature, we can add it like so:

```lua
FeatureMgr.AddFeature(Utils.Joaat("ExampleButton"), "Click Me", eFeatureType.Button, "", function(feat)
    GUI.AddToast("Example Script", "You clicked the button!", 3000)
end)
```

Alright, we have our first feature, now we can render it by modifying the render function we made previously:

```lua
local function render()
    if ClickGUI.BeginCustomChildWindow("Example") then
        ClickGUI.RenderFeature(Utils.Joaat("ExampleButton"))
        ClickGUI.EndCustomChildWindow()
    end
end
```

That's all there is to it, now if you run the script via the Lua Editor tab on Cherax, then go to the Lua Content tab, you will see a new tab called Example, and on it, you will see our button, which when you click, will show you a toast.
