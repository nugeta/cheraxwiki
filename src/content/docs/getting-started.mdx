## Disabling real-time protection

The reason behind having to always turn off your antivirus when using a software like a mod menu or a similar tool is because of the ways antiviruses treat these kinds of softwares.

Basically:

- For a cheat or similar software to work, it **must** access the in game memory to read important values to function properly, like let's say your GTA money, or players around you for ESP.
- An antivirus analyzes this action and flags it as suspicious.
- If you check most of these tools on a site like Virustotal or similar, you can actually see that the antiviruses classify them as "Hacktool"-s. This also applies to similar tools in the category.

In the case that you don't want to **fully** kill off Defender or whatever Antivirus you're using, most of the softwares offer "Exclusions", which you can use to make a folder that is excluded from scans, therefore doesn't trigger your antivirus once you run stuff from it.

## Disabling BattlEye

The disabling process of BattlEye varies from platform to platform, here are the steps for every single one:

- If you're using the Rockstar Games Launcher, simply go to your settings and tick off BattlEye
- If you're using Steam, you have to open your library, right click your installed copy of GTA, then Properties, and type in the launch option "-nobattleye" (no quotation marks)
- If you're using Epic Games, it's basically the same as Steam, you go to your library, click the 3 dots around your copy of GTA, then you can go to options and put "-nobattleye" as a launch argument

In the case that you wanna play with BE turned on later, just trace your steps back, aka tick battleye back on and/or remove the launch arguments.

(sorry for the stutters in the video lmao I'm an ESL, also i meant to say "directly launch from steam")
